# Version manager
This Maven project module, written in Java, can be used for managing the specific chosen tool versions.

## Dependencies
All project dependencies are listed in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file.

## Import the project
In order to import the project correctly into the integrated development environment (e.g. Eclipse), it is necessary to download the project together with all its dependencies.
The project and all its dependencies are based on the concept of "project object model" and hence Apache Maven is used for the specific purpose.

_Please note that the "SWT.jar" and the "Jface.jar" libraries (if used) must be downloaded and installed manually in the Maven local repository since are custom versions used in the tool ((install 3rd party jars)[https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html])._
